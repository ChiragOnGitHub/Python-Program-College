# DU Semester 3 Practicals
Python program for B.Sc. (Hons.) C.S. Sem-3 Practicals


1. Write a function that takes the lengths of three sides : side1 , side2 and side3 of
the triangle as the input from the user using input function and return the area
and perimeter of the triangle as a tuple. Also, assert that sum of the length of any
two sides is greater than the third side.

2. Consider a showroom of electronic products, where there are various
salesmen. Each salesman is given a commission of 5%,depending on the sales
made per month.Incase the sale done is less than 50000,then the salesman is
not given any commission. Write a function to calculate totalsales of a salesman
in a month,commission and remarks for the salesman. Sales done by each
salesman per week is to be provided as input. Use tuples/list to store data of
salesmen.

    Assign remarks according to the following criteria:
- Excellent : Sales>=80000
- Good : Sales >= 60000 and < 80000
- Average : Sales >= 40000 and < 60000
- WorkHard : Sales < 40000

3. Write a Python function to find the nth term of Fibonacci sequence and its
factorial. Return the result as a list.

4. Write a function that takes a number(>=10) as an input and return the digits of
the number as a set.

5. Write a function that finds the sum of then terms of the following series.
Import the factorial function created in question 4.

    1 – x2 / 2! + x4 / 4! – x6 / 6! + … xn / n!

6. Consider a tuplet1 = {1,2,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,10}. Write a program to perform following
operations:

    a) Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple.

    b) Concatenate a tuplet2 = {11,13,15) with t1.

    c) Return maximum and minimum value from this tuple.


7. Write a menu driven program to perform the following on strings :

   a) Find the length of string.
 
   b) Return maximum of three strings. 
 
   c) Accept a string and replace all vowels with “#” 
 
   d) Find number of words in the given string. 
 
   e) Check whether the string is a palindrome or not.
